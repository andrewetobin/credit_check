# Background: Luhn Algorithm
The Luhn algorithm is a check-summing algorithm best known for checking the validity of credit card numbers.

You can checkout the full description on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm

**Description**

(adapted from Wikipedia)

The formula verifies a number against its included check digit, which is usually appended to a partial account number to generate the full account number. This full account number must pass the following test:

* from the rightmost digit, which is the check digit, moving left, double the value of every second digit
* if product of this doubling operation is greater than 9 (e.g., 7 * 2 = 14), then sum the digits of the products (e.g., 10: 1 + 0 = 1, 14: 1 + 4 = 5).
* take the sum of all the digits
* if and only if the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 then the number is valid

#### Example
**Validating an Account Number**

Using ``79927398713`` as our sample input:
```
Account number:        7   9   9   2   7   3   9   8   7   1   3
2x every other digit:  7   18  9   4   7   6   9   16  7   2   3
Summed digits over 10: 7   9   9   4   7   6   9   7   7   2   3
Results summed:        7   9   9   4   7   6   9   7   7   2   3 = 70
Modulo Ten:            70 % 10 == 0
```
Since the summed results modulo ``10`` is zero, the account number is valid according to the algorithm.


#### Iteration 1 - The Luhn Algorithm
Start with this template and save it as ``credit_check.rb`` in your ``lib`` directory:
```
card_number = "4929735477250543"

 Your Luhn Algorithm Here

 Output
 If it is valid, print "The number is valid!"
 If it is invalid, print "The number is invalid!"
 ```
**Sample Data**

If helpful, you can use the following sample data:

* *Valid*: 5541808923795240, 4024007136512380, 6011797668867828
* *Invalid*: 5541801923795240, 4024007106512380, 6011797668868728

#### Iteration 2 - Github and Classes

* Create a repository on Github and push your algorithm to it. From here on, all your code should be hosted on Github.

* Create a class that responds to the following interaction pattern:
```
credit_check = CreditCheck.new
=> #<CreditCheck:0x00007fe82d2a8a38>
credit_check.valid_number?(5541808923795240)
=> true
credit_check.valid_number?(5541801923795240)
=> false
credit_check.validation_output(5541808923795240)
=> "The number 5541808923795240 is valid"
credit_check.validation_output(5541801923795240)
=> "The number 5541801923795240 is invalid"
```
**note on interaction patterns**: this means that you should be able to open a pry session, require the file with your class, for instance ``require './credit_check'``, and type in the lines of code above exactly and get the same output in your pry session.

#### Iteration 3 - Branching and Minitest
* Create a branch in your local git repo called testing

* Create a Minitest test that accurately covers the expected behavior of your CreditCheck class

* Push the branch up to your Github repository and merge the branch using a Pull Request

#### Iteration 4 - Extensions
* Create a command line interface that allows the user to validate a number

* Add functionality to calculate the check sum digit.

* Can you make it work for American Express numbers? ``342804633855673`` is valid but ``342801633855673`` is invalid
